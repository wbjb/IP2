TRIANGLE TRACKER

Getting Started
#Simply, open the index.html to access the program.

Prerequisites
# Adobe Flash Player


Objective
# The point of this application is to tell whether a triangle, after 3 user inputs as 'measurements', is a scalene, equiangular, isosceles, or not a triangle.

Example
# The program will ask for a value 3 times, prompting after each input, and then will return the type of triangle.
# For example if I give the number 4 for all the 3 times it asks, it will return "Equilateral".

#To access this, just open the file in a browser of your choice, one that has adobe flash player installed, then you will be prompted thrice for input.
