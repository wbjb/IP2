# TRIANGLE TRACKER

# Getting Started
Simply, open the index.html to access the program.

#Prerequisites

Adobe Flash Player


# Objective

 The point of this application is to tell whether a triangle, after 3 user inputs as 'measurements', is a scalene, equiangular, isosceles, or not a triangle.

# Example

The program will ask for a value 3 times, prompting after each input, and then will return the type of triangle.
 For example if I give the number 4 for all the 3 times it asks, it will return "Equilateral".

To access this, just open the file in a browser of your choice, one that has adobe flash player installed, then you will be prompted thrice for input.

# BDD functionality

If the length of one side is greater than the other two sides combined, then the program will return a message stating that is not a triangle.

If the length of two sides of the triangle are equal, the result returned will be isosceles.

If the length of all sides are congruent to each other, the program will return equilateral.

If none of the sides are congruent to each other, the program will return scalene.
